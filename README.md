# PROJECT_PRO_REACT
I finished basic front_end for Artykul with commends( i spend some time for them i hope that can clear something out )

Dont forget to fork this so you can work on your own repo and sync with this by making pull request


TODO List
 
 -Add same front-end for Producents and Kategorias
 
 -Clear front-end structure( from example components)
 
 -Change styles
 
 -Make front look like something other then template
 
 -Read some github docs (at least about fork , pull request branches and so on)
 
 -Read React tutorials

TODO List for me;)
 -i will try to implement Redux as it should greatly help with managing state of components(now it doesnt seems like much but when you have components of them it will become much worth)
